Stanford PLY
============

.. rst-class:: px-badges

``.ply`` ``read + write`` ``lazy: binary only``

Summary of the specification
----------------------------

PLY - the Stanford Triangle Format - stores a mesh as a list of named elements, typically ``vertex`` and ``face``, each declared in an ASCII header along with its property names and scalar types. The body that follows is either ASCII text or a packed binary block in the byte order the header names. Because the header is self-describing, PLY can carry arbitrary per-vertex and per-face attributes: colours, normals, confidence, intensity.

Specification at a glance
-------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 28 72
   :class: px-spec-table

   * - magic / header
     - ply, then format ascii | binary_little_endian | binary_big_endian 1.0
   * - structure
     - element <name> <count> declarations, each followed by its property lines
   * - scalar types
     - char uchar short ushort int uint float double, plus list <count-type> <item-type>
   * - faces
     - property list uchar int vertex_indices - 0-based, arbitrary polygon size
   * - comments
     - comment lines anywhere in the header; obj_info for producer metadata
   * - published by
     - Greg Turk, Stanford University

Reading
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import polyxios as px

    mesh = px.read("model.ply")
    mesh.vertices          # (n, 3)
    mesh.element_types     # element groups found in the file

Binary bodies can be memory-mapped instead of loaded:

.. code-block:: python

    mesh = px.read("big.ply", lazy=True)

Writing
-------

.. code-block:: python

    px.write(mesh, "out.ply")

Format-specific options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 20 56
   :class: px-spec-table

   * - Option
     - Default
     - Effect
   * - ``binary``
     - ``False``
     - Write a packed binary body instead of ASCII.
   * - ``endian``
     - ``"little"``
     - Byte order of the binary body; "big" emits binary_big_endian.

Quirks worth knowing
--------------------

.. rst-class:: px-quirks

- Vertex properties beyond x/y/z - colour, normals, confidence, intensity - are preserved as named vertex attributes rather than dropped.
- Lazy loading applies to binary bodies only; an ASCII file must be parsed in full before any value is available.
- Index widths are checked against the declared vertex count, so a mesh too large for the header's list type raises instead of truncating.
