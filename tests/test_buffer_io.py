"""Reading and writing through a file object instead of a path.

``polyxios.read`` and ``polyxios.write`` take an open binary handle wherever
they take a path, so a mesh can round-trip through ``io.BytesIO``, a socket's
``makefile('rb')`` or a file inside an archive without ever touching disk.

The parametrised tests below are the contract: for every writable format, a
buffer must produce the same bytes as a path, and reading those bytes back must
produce the same mesh. Anything a handle cannot do - inferring a format it has
no name for, mmap over an in-memory buffer, a format split across two files -
has its own test naming what is refused and why.

The mesh table lives in ``tests/test_roundtrip.py``: this file is about the
plumbing, not about what each format keeps.
