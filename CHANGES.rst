0.4.0 (2026-09-09)
------------------

Meshes read and written over file objects and gzip alike, one new format,
entity numbering and whole-mesh metadata that survive a round trip, and an
extension shared by several formats resolved by what the file holds.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``read()`` and ``write()`` now take an open binary file object wherever
  they take a path, so a mesh round-trips through ``io.BytesIO``, a socket
  or a file inside an archive without touching disk. A handle polyxios was
  given is read or written where it stands and is never closed. A buffer
  with no file name cannot have its format inferred, so ``fmt=`` is
  required there; a handle from ``open()`` carries its own extension and
  does not need it. TetGen is the exception: a ``.node``/``.ele`` pair is
  two files and still needs a path.
- Lazy reads over a file object work when the handle is backed by a real
  file and stands at its start - mmap needs a descriptor and addresses a
  file from byte zero - and raise ``LazyReadError`` naming the reason for an
  in-memory buffer or a handle part-way into a file. Only the formats whose
  lazy read hands back arrays viewing the mapping ask for that. Binary STL's
  lazy mode copies what it reads - it skips vertex deduplication and nothing
  else - so it takes a buffer like any other read rather than sending the
  caller to an eager read that would merge the vertices it was asked to keep.
- gzip is now transparent for every format: a file opening with the gzip
  magic is decompressed on the way in, whatever it is named, and a
  destination named ``.gz`` is compressed on the way out. ``.vol.gz`` is
  read as Netgen rather than refused, ``.gz`` names the compression rather
  than the format when a codec is chosen - in ``fmt=`` as well as in a file
  name - and the compressed output is byte-reproducible (no timestamp, no
  embedded name). ``fmt=".obj.gz"`` is how a nameless buffer asks for
  compression, since it has no name to end in ``.gz``. A compressed member
  need not run to the end of what it sits in, so a mesh gzipped into the
  middle of an archive reads without the bytes after it becoming an error,
  and a file holding several members back to back - what ``cat a.gz b.gz``
  leaves - is read and measured as the whole it decompresses to. A path and
  a file object go through the same reader, so one compressed file reads the
  same way and fails the same way whichever it was handed over as. A
  destination that compresses on its own, such as a handle from
  ``gzip.open()``, is written to as it is rather than compressed a second
  time. Lazy reads still need an uncompressed file and say so, and TetGen -
  which opens its own sibling files rather than going through this layer -
  refuses a compressed file rather than parsing it as text, by its content on
  the way in and by its name on the way out, and for whichever half of the
  pair carries it rather than only for the one the caller named. Whether a
  source is compressed is decided by the whole four-byte gzip header rather
  than by the two magic bytes alone: those open one file in every 65536 by
  chance,
  and in a headerless binary format they are an ordinary coordinate's low
  mantissa bytes - a ``.splat`` whose first x is 10.658965 opens with exactly
  them and is a mesh, not an archive.
- The formats that check a header against the size of the file it came from
  now take that size from the read they were already making rather than
  measuring the source separately. Measuring a compressed one cost a whole
  decompression pass that the read then repeated, and a stream that cannot
  seek could not be measured at all, so legacy VTK, the VTK XML formats and
  ``.splat`` read one pass faster and from more kinds of source than before.
- Extensions several unrelated formats share are now resolved by looking
  inside the file. A codec declares ``SNIFF_EXTENSIONS``, a
  ``sniff(head) -> bool`` test and a ``SNIFF_PRIORITY``; the contested
  extension resolves to a dispatcher that delegates to the first codec
  recognising the opening bytes, and names the candidates when none does.
  Writing to such an extension raises, an output file having no content to
  inspect.
- ``.dat`` is the first user of this: a Tecplot header resolves to the
  Tecplot codec, a bulk data card to the Nastran one. It no longer needs
  ``fmt=``, which still works for the cases sniffing cannot settle.
- ``.plt`` is registered to the Tecplot codec so a binary Tecplot file is
  told what is wrong instead of resolving nowhere. Reading it is not
  supported.
- ``PolyData.topological_dimension`` reports the highest dimension the mesh
  actually holds - 0 for points, 1 for lines, 2 for surfaces, 3 for volumes -
  taking the maximum over the element types present, so a tetrahedral mesh
  that also carries its boundary triangles still reads as 3-D. It is the
  dimension of the elements, not of the space they sit in: a triangle mesh
  embedded in 3-D is 2-D. An empty mesh is 0.
- ``transforms.merge_duplicate_vertices`` welds coincident vertices into
  one, the equivalent of ParaView's "Clean to Grid". Formats that write a
  corner per element - STL above all - hand back a soup of unconnected
  vertices, and welding is what turns it back into a surface. ``tol=``
  snaps coordinates to a grid of that step before comparing; the default
  welds only exactly equal ones, and a ``tol`` so small that snapping
  overflows to infinity is refused rather than welding every point it
  overflowed. The survivor of each group is its lowest original index and
  keeps its own coordinates and attributes, so the result does not depend
  on which duplicate the file listed first and a tolerance never moves a
  point. Welding is not culling: a vertex no
  element references is kept - compose with ``remove_orphan_vertices`` to
  drop those too.
- Kratos MDPA ``.mdpa`` is read and written: nodes, elements named by Kratos
  element class, conditions, ``Properties`` ids, ``NodalData`` and
  ``ElementalData`` variables, ``ModelPartData`` and nested ``SubModelPart``
  groups. The class name and the geometry do not identify each other -
  ``Element3D4N`` is a tetrahedron, and a quadrilateral in space would want
  the same name - so the writer spells the class with the element's
  topological dimension, which makes the pair unique and keeps a round trip
  exact. Reading is wider: the ``<n>D<m>N`` suffix is read off whatever
  application element carries it (``SmallDisplacementElement3D4N``,
  ``VMS3D4N``), and the explicit geometry names (``Tetrahedra3D4``,
  ``Prism3D6``) are recognised too. ``Conditions`` are read as elements,
  since they are cells of the same mesh; they are written back under
  ``Elements``: which cells a solver should treat as boundary is a modelling
  choice the mesh does not carry.
- The numbers a file gave its nodes and elements now survive a round trip.
  An Abaqus deck, a Nastran bulk data file, a Gmsh ``.msh``, a FLAC3D grid
  and an MDPA file all number entities freely, and renumbering them 1..n
  leaves the author's other files - a load case naming ``GRID 7000001``, a
  report keyed on element ``4001`` - pointing at the wrong thing. The reader
  records what the file said in ``vertex_attrs["original_ids"]`` /
  ``element_attrs["original_ids"]`` and the writer puts it back. The key is
  not format-prefixed, so a mesh read from a ``.bdf`` and written as ``.msh``
  keeps its numbering. Only a numbering the index does not already say is
  stored: a file numbering ``1..n`` in order records nothing, since the
  writer's own renumbering reproduces it. Ids that a transform has since
  invalidated - ``merge`` collides two meshes that each numbered from one,
  splitting a cell leaves two entities carrying one id - are checked at the
  point of writing rather than trusted, and a mesh that lost its numbering
  gets dense ids and a warning rather than a file no solver loads. A format
  that numbers densely by construction has no id of its own to record and
  ignores the key on write; whether it carries one comes down to whether it
  has a general attribute channel, so a mesh read from a ``.bdf``, welded and
  written as ``.vtu`` keeps the ids of the vertices that survived, while OFF
  or STL drop the key with every other attribute.
- Two-dimensional files now follow one rule across every format that can
  spell one. A mesh always carries three coordinate columns, a file that
  declared two is padded with ``z=0``, and the fact is recorded in
  ``global_attrs["was_2d"]`` so a writer can drop the column again. It says
  something about the mesh rather than about the file it came from, so a
  plane read as a 2-D Netgen ``.vol`` - which has no two-dimensional
  spelling of its own to write back - still lands as an ``NDIME= 2`` SU2
  case. Medit, Medit binary, SU2, Netgen, TetGen, MFEM, DOLFIN, Tecplot,
  Abaqus and WKT all record it on the way in, and every one of those but
  Netgen restores it on the way out. Coordinates outrank the flag: a mesh
  flagged two-dimensional whose vertices have since left the plane is
  written in three, with a warning, rather than being flattened in silence.

- Whole-mesh metadata now travels through the VTK family. ``.vtu``, ``.vtp``,
  ``.vti``, ``.vtr`` and ``.vts`` read and write a ``<FieldData>`` block, and
  legacy ``.vtk`` reads and writes a ``FIELD FieldData`` block between the
  ``DATASET`` line and the geometry - so a time value, a material constant or
  a solver tolerance in ``global_attrs`` survives a write instead of being
  dropped. A legacy ``STRUCTURED_POINTS``, ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` or
  ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` file reads the block too, which is where VTK's own
  writer puts a time value. The block holds arrays: a scalar comes back as a one-element array,
  a field array keeps the type it was held in, and a value no numeric array
  holds is dropped with a warning naming the key. A structured codec spells
  its own grid entries - ``vti_extent``, ``vtr_extents``, ``vts_extent`` and
  their neighbours - from the mesh on the way out, so those never travel as
  field data in the format that records them; every other key does, and a
  structured read takes its own grid over anything a field block names.

- Text in ``global_attrs`` travels through the VTK XML family. A
  ``<FieldData>`` block holds a ``String`` array beside its numeric ones, so a
  name, a title or a solver's own label - an Abaqus ``*HEADING`` among them -
  reaches a ``.vtu``, ``.vtp``, ``.vti``, ``.vtr`` or ``.vts`` and comes home
  a string. One VTK itself wrote is read the same way, where such an array
  used to be skipped with a warning about holding no numbers. A list of
  strings is one array of several tuples and comes back the list it was. The
  legacy ``FIELD`` block spells no text at all, so a string handed to a
  ``.vtk`` is still dropped with a warning naming the key.

- Abaqus ``.inp`` reads a ``*HEADING`` card into
  ``global_attrs["abaqus_heading"]`` and writes it back, so the deck's own
  title survives a round trip. polyxios's own banner stays a comment, so a
  deck that never had a heading does not gain one.

- ``helper.read_blocks`` and ``helper.read_multiblock`` read every VTK index
  file - ``.vtm``, ``.pvtu``, ``.pvtp``, ``.pvtr``, ``.pvts``, ``.pvti``, and
  a ``.vtp`` holding a ``<vtkMultiBlockDataSet>`` - where
  ``read_multiblock_vtp`` read only the last of those. The first hands back
  one ``PolyData`` per sub-file and the second merges them, so blocks that
  mean different things can stay apart. An index naming another index is
  followed and read flat, a pair naming each other is read once, a missing or
  unreadable sub-file is skipped with a warning - the one the operating
  system refuses among them - and a reference resolving outside the index
  file's directory still raises ``PermissionError``, now
  ``helper.Traversal``, which is one.
  ``read()`` itself keeps handing back exactly one mesh, and the meta-file
  refusals now name these two functions.

- Tag groups travel through the VTK family. ``.vtk``, ``.vtu``, ``.vtp``,
  ``.vti``, ``.vtr`` and ``.vts`` write one point or cell column of ones and
  zeros per group, named ``polyxios_tag_<group>``, and read it back as the
  group. None of those formats has a set of its own, and one column per group
  is what keeps an element in two groups in both - which the single reference
  a Medit or Netgen record carries cannot say. A column of that name holding
  anything but whole numbers stays an attribute, since a member rounded into
  place names the wrong element.

- An Abaqus ``*SURFACE`` is read and written. A surface names a side of an
  element, which the deck holds no element for, so polyxios reads it as the
  triangle or quadrilateral that side describes, tagged with the surface's
  name - the way the UGRID, SU2 and Netgen readers already hand back their
  boundary faces. Two element attributes carry the link back:
  ``face_parent``, the element it is a face of, and ``face_index``, which of
  that element's faces. Writing puts the ``*Surface`` card back, with its
  parent ``*Elset`` marked ``internal`` the way Abaqus marks its own, and an
  internal set a surface named is dropped on the way in, so a round trip is
  stable; one no surface names is a group the deck's author wrote and is kept.
  A ``*Surface, type=NODE`` becomes a vertex tag - one member per data line,
  since the field after it is a weight factor and a whole number is as good a
  weight as a node id - and goes back out as the ``*Nset`` it now is, a node
  set and a node surface being the same members under two cards. ``SPOS`` or
  ``SNEG`` on a shell tags the element itself rather than duplicating it. The two columns are read back wherever
  they hold whole numbers, so a deck that went out through a format carrying
  every attribute as a double, legacy ``.vtk`` among them, still writes its
  surfaces back. ``transforms.merge`` shifts ``face_parent`` onto the mesh it
  is building, the way it already shifted the tag groups, so the surfaces of
  two meshes joined into one - the blocks of an index file among them -
  survive the join instead of naming the first mesh's elements.
- ``read()`` now forwards the options it does not recognise to the codec it
  chose, the way ``write()`` already did, and so does the dispatcher a
  contested extension resolves through. An option a reader does not take
  raises ``TypeError`` naming it. STL's ``merge_vertices`` was written as a
  read option and had never been reachable without importing the codec
  itself; it is now ``read(path, merge_vertices=False)``.
- OBJ reads ``split_seams=True``, which keeps the texture coordinates and
  normals a per-vertex array otherwise drops. OBJ indexes ``vt`` and ``vn``
  per face corner, so a vertex on a seam is given two texture coordinates and
  one on a hard edge two normals, and folding them one per vertex kept the
  last. Splitting copies the vertex once per distinct pairing its corners
  name: the first corner keeps the index it had and each later one takes a
  fresh index off the end, so a vertex no face names stays where it was, the
  faces keep their count and their order, and a file whose corners agree
  reads exactly as it does without the option. Records nothing indexes are
  counted against the ``v`` records the file wrote rather than the vertices
  the split left, and a copy takes what the vertex it came from takes. The
  warning about the values it drops now names the option that keeps them.

Behaviour changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Medit ``.mesh`` records a two-dimensional file in
  ``global_attrs["was_2d"]`` rather than keeping the file's own number in
  ``global_attrs["medit_dimension"]``, which is now the shared spelling
  every format uses. A three-dimensional file sets nothing, where it used to
  set ``medit_dimension: 3``.
- Formats that had always written three coordinate columns now write two for
  a mesh that came from a two-dimensional file and has stayed flat: TetGen's
  ``.node`` header declares 2, a Tecplot zone declares ``X`` and ``Y``
  alone, an Abaqus node card carries two coordinates, and a ``.meshb``
  header declares ``Dimension 2``. Two of those constrain the rest of the
  file, and the writer keeps them consistent rather than emitting one no
  reader loads: an Abaqus deck of two-column node cards is written under the
  planar element cards - ``CPS3``, ``CPS4``, ``T2D2`` - since Abaqus takes a
  node's dimensionality from the element referencing it, and a Tecplot zone
  keeps its third coordinate variable when the mesh carries a variable of its
  own named ``Z``, which the positional naming would otherwise read back as
  the z column. A mesh holding an element type with no planar Abaqus card - a
  solid, a biquadratic quad - or an ``element_type=`` override naming a
  three-dimensional card stays three-dimensional too. A flat mesh of solid
  cells - a tetrahedron is one however flat it lies - keeps its third column
  everywhere the node count per element is declared separately from the
  coordinate count: an MFEM ``vertices`` block, a Tecplot ``ET=TETRAHEDRON``
  zone, a TetGen ``.ele`` file, a Medit ``Tetrahedra`` section in either
  spelling and a DOLFIN ``celltype="tetrahedron"`` each need three, whatever
  the flag says. A ``dim=`` given to the DOLFIN writer by name is the
  caller's own word and is left alone.

- Text formats are written with ``\n`` line endings on every platform.
  Writing used to go through ``Path.write_text``, which turned them into
  ``\r\n`` on Windows; every write now goes through the same binary path a
  buffer does, so the bytes a path receives and the bytes a ``BytesIO``
  receives are the same ones. Every reader already accepted either ending.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- A legacy ``.vtk`` ``SCALARS`` header names between one and four components
  and no more. The writer spelled every tuple it had no ``VECTORS`` or
  ``TENSORS`` branch for as ``SCALARS`` whatever its width, so a nine-component
  per-element array went out as ``SCALARS name double 9`` - a count outside
  the range the format gives that field, which leaves what the file means to
  how forgiving each reader happens to be. Such a tuple now travels as a
  ``FIELD`` array, whose
  own header carries the component count and so has no ceiling; four
  components and under keep the ``SCALARS`` spelling and its lookup table. An
  array of no components at all is outside the same range from the other end,
  and is dropped with a warning before its section header is written rather
  than spelled ``SCALARS name double 0``.

- A binary block in a legacy ``.vtk`` file is closed by a newline, and the
  keyword line after it is found by reading to the next one. Only the
  dataset's ``FIELD`` block wrote that newline: the points, the cells, the
  cell types and every attribute array ran straight into the keyword after
  them, so the terminator a reader found was the first ``0x0a`` inside the
  following payload and the keyword line it read began in the middle of the
  numbers - a file whose sections a reader could only find by hunting for
  the keyword, as polyxios itself did. Every binary block now closes the way
  the format says, and a file written before this still reads: the newline
  is stepped over where it is there rather than required.

- A symmetric tensor's six components are ``XX``, ``YY``, ``ZZ``, ``XY``,
  ``YZ``, ``XZ`` - the order VTK itself hands back for the cell at
  ``(i, j)``. The writer mirrored a six-component array into the full 3x3 a
  ``TENSORS`` section holds using the classical Voigt order instead, whose
  last three run the other way, so ``XZ`` and ``YZ`` came out in each other's
  places. Nothing downstream can tell that from a tensor that was always that
  way, which is why it went unseen.

- The two numbers on a legacy ``.vtk`` v4.2 ``CELLS`` line count the cells
  and the values that follow them. The second was taken from the length of
  the whole connectivity array rather than from the run the offsets name.
  The two are the same for a mesh built here, but a mesh holding a
  connectivity its last offset stops short of - a slice kept at its original
  length - declared values the section never went on to write, which leaves
  the next reader inside the numbers. Both spellings now declare what they
  write, and the spelled one no longer says one thing where the binary one
  says another.

- The first number on a legacy ``.vtk`` v5.1 ``CELLS`` line counts the
  offsets that follow it, and every offset past the first names a cell.
  The whole offsets array was written whatever the mesh's cell count, so a
  mesh holding one kept at a buffer's original length declared cells the
  ``CELL_TYPES`` after it never named - and a reader that believes the
  offsets builds them anyway, taking each one's type from past the end of
  the array that holds it. Both sections now stop at the cells the types
  name. An offsets array that begins partway into the connectivity is
  rebased onto the run written after it, so the two versions answer such a
  mesh with the same cells rather than only v4.2 doing so.

- An attribute array whose row count is not the one its section covers is
  dropped, with a warning, before that section is declared. Only the section
  header says where one of its arrays ends, so an array of more rows ran past
  that end and one of fewer stopped short of it, and either way the reader
  took the values on the wrong side of the boundary for the keyword line that
  should have been there - costing every array after it in the section as
  well. VTK's own reader stopped on such a file with ``Unsupported cell
  attribute type``.

- A legacy ``.vtk`` ``TENSORS6`` section is read as the six components it
  holds. VTK 9 writes a symmetric tensor with that keyword, and every reader
  here matched it as a ``TENSORS`` and took its tuples for nine: an ASCII file
  failed with a ``CodecError`` about a row that is not numbers, and a binary
  one read six values plus whatever followed them, then went on from the
  middle of the next array and dropped every array after it. The six are
  mirrored into the full 3x3, so a mesh holds one tensor shape whichever
  spelling the file used.

- An array whose name holds XML markup - an ampersand, a quote, an angle
  bracket, as a group named in another format may - is written escaped by the
  VTK XML formats. It used to close the ``Name`` attribute early and leave a
  file no reader could parse, polyxios's own included. A name holding a
  newline, a carriage return or a tab is escaped as a numeric reference for
  the same reason: written as it stands, an XML parser normalises it to a
  space and the array comes back under a name it never had. Legacy ``.vtk``
  has no escaping to fall back on, so an array whose name holds whitespace is
  dropped with a warning there rather than written as a name and a stray
  token. A name holding a character XML has no spelling for at all - a
  control character, which no numeric reference reaches either - is dropped
  with a warning by the XML formats for the same reason.

- A legacy ``.vtk`` ``FIELD`` header that leaves its type field out is read as
  the ``float`` the ASCII scan has always defaulted it to, where the binary
  scan skipped the array and carried on framing the block from the wrong
  offset. The format makes the field mandatory, so this only ever answers a
  malformed header - but the two scans have to answer it the same way, or one
  file reads back as two different meshes depending on how it was written. A
  header short of the name, component count and tuple count that frame its
  payload is refused by both for the same reason, as is a block that declares
  more arrays than the file holds, and as is one whose component or tuple
  count is negative - the two are multiplied into the length of a payload,
  and a negative one walked the binary scan backwards off the front of the
  file and reshaped to a dimension numpy infers rather than the one the
  header claimed.

- Every legacy ``.vtk`` reader looks for its keywords below the ``DATASET``
  line. The second line of the file is a free-text title, and the two readers
  that scanned from the top of the file read one beginning with a keyword as
  that keyword's header: a ``POLYDATA`` mesh titled ``Vertices of a cow`` or
  ``Points of interest`` was refused, and the ``FIELD`` block this release
  adds widened that to any title beginning ``Field``. The line is found
  rather than counted, so a header carrying a blank line between its four is
  read too, where an ``UNSTRUCTURED_GRID`` reader counting to four missed the
  first keyword after it.

- A legacy ``.vtk`` cell array is read against what its block actually holds.
  A ``CELLS`` row, or a ``POLYGONS`` cell, declaring more vertices than it
  goes on to list used to be trusted twice over: the row kept the indices it
  had while the offsets advanced by the width it claimed, so every cell after
  it was cut out of the wrong place - and the binary spelling of the same
  fault reached numpy as a bare ``IndexError`` naming neither the file nor
  the cell. Both are now a ``CodecError`` that names them.

- Every remaining legacy ``.vtk`` section that reads numbers off ASCII lines
  says which file and which section a malformed one came out of. ``POINTS``,
  ``CELL_TYPES``, a ``X_COORDINATES`` array and a ``STRUCTURED_GRID``
  ``POINTS`` block used to hand a bare ``ValueError`` about one token, or a
  reshape, to a caller that had asked to read a file; a section that runs
  into the keyword after it, or that the file ends inside, is refused by
  name. A ``DATASET FIELD`` array the file runs out inside is dropped with a
  warning instead of being reshaped into a shape it cannot fill. Thirty
  thousand mutations of six corrupt files now leave the codec raising only
  ``CodecError``.

- ``transforms.merge`` keeps the surfaces of a mesh whose ``face_parent``
  and ``face_index`` columns are doubles - which is every mesh that went out
  through legacy ``.vtk``, where a cell array is a double whatever it held.
  Merging one with a mesh carrying no such column fills that mesh's rows with
  the blank a float dtype spells, NaN, and a NaN was read as a column that
  could not be trusted at all rather than as the ``-1`` that says "not a
  face" - so every surface the first mesh did carry was dropped without a
  word, which is the loss shifting the column exists to prevent.

- A ``<FieldData>`` name that more than one ``Piece`` of a ``.vtu`` or
  ``.vtp`` spells keeps the first piece's value and is reported. The mesh's
  metadata is one mapping over the joined mesh, so folding the pieces with a
  plain update kept the last - a value a reader of a single-piece file would
  never have seen, and a loss no warning named. The dataset's own block still
  wins over every piece.

- A legacy ``.vtk`` ``POINT_DATA`` or ``CELL_DATA`` header is written only
  once its arrays are known to be nameable. A section whose names all hold
  whitespace - which the format's whitespace-separated header field cannot
  spell - used to declare itself over nothing, the way the ``FIELD`` block
  already refused to. The names are now checked once per section rather than
  once per array, so the warning names them together.

- A legacy ``.vtk`` ASCII ``POINTS`` or ``CELLS`` block wrapped over several
  lines is read. Both are a run of numbers the header counts, and VTK's own
  reader takes them as one however they are broken up; read a row at a time,
  a wrapped ``POINTS`` block silently kept three numbers of each line and
  dropped the rest, and a wrapped ``CELLS`` block was refused for a row that
  was never short. One row to a cell is still the path every file VTK writes
  takes, and the run is gathered only once a row turns out not to hold its
  own cell whole - so a well-formed file pays nothing for it, and a file that
  is malformed either way is still named by its row.

- The Cython fast paths for those two blocks are bounds-checked. They are
  compiled with ``boundscheck=False``, which takes the check off their list
  indexing as well as off their arrays, so a header declaring more rows than
  the file holds, or a ``CELLS`` row holding no tokens at all - a blank line
  inside the block, which the wrapped-block reader above takes in its stride -
  read past the end of a list: a segmentation fault on a file the reader was
  handed, not a diagnosis. The counts are numbers out of the file and are now
  checked once per block, the row is checked before its first token is
  indexed, and its own width against the tokens it lists. A width is held in
  a machine word rather than a C ``int`` besides, since one past two billion
  raised out of the conversion itself, before the check that names the row -
  so both paths refuse the same files with the same sentence whether or not
  the extension was built.

- A tag group of a shape numpy builds no array of - a ragged list of lists, a
  mapping, a column of names - is reported by every writer rather than raising
  out of the middle of one. ``vertex_tags`` and ``element_tags`` are not
  checked on the way in, and such a group used to reach a bare ``ValueError``
  about an inhomogeneous shape in whichever codec looked at it first. It names
  no entity, which is the loss the ``.inp``, ``.msh``, ``.su2``, ``.vol``,
  ``.ugrid``, ``.f3grid``, ``.mdpa``, ``.node``, ``.obj`` and VTK writers
  already report for a group whose members index nothing.

- A ``<FieldData>`` block naming one array twice keeps the first and says so,
  the way one whose name two ``Piece`` elements spell already did. A mesh's
  metadata holds one value per key, and taking the last meant one file read
  back two ways depending on the order its blocks were walked in. A legacy
  ``.vtk`` ``FIELD`` block answers a repeated name the same way, where all
  three of its parsers took the last without a word: one mesh has to read
  back the same whichever spelling of the format it was written in.

- A ``DATASET FIELD`` file holding a ``string`` array is read rather than
  hung on. Its lines were counted from the array's own header, so one
  declaring no strings never reached a line to step over and the reader
  looped on the header for ever - a file of five lines that never returned.
  Counting them after the header ends that, and ends an off-by-one with it:
  an array of one string used to leave its text behind to be read as the
  header of an array of its own. A component or tuple count that is negative
  is skipped there too, the way the ``FIELD`` block inside a mesh already
  refuses one: the two are multiplied into a length, and a negative one
  sliced the values read from the wrong end and stored an empty array under
  a name the file never spelled.

- Every face in the table of a volume element's sides is wound so its normal
  points out of the element. One face of each - a hexahedron's and a
  pyramid's base, a wedge's and either prism's bottom, and three of a
  voxel's six - was wound the other way, so ``transforms.extract_surface``
  handed back a skin lit from inside along those faces, which is the shape
  that reads as a hole in the mesh. The numbering is unchanged, so an Abaqus
  ``S<n>`` and a ``face_index`` still name the face they always did.

- A chain of VTK index files each naming the next is followed to a fixed
  depth rather than as far as it is long. An index naming a parent of its
  own was already refused, but a chain is no cycle: a deep enough one
  recursed past the interpreter's own limit, and the ``RecursionError``
  surfaced as a block that could not be read rather than as the file it was.

- An ``abaqus_heading`` whose text would end the ``*Heading`` card is dropped
  with a warning rather than written into the deck. A heading is free text
  and travels through every format with a metadata slot, so it comes back
  holding whatever was put in it; written unchanged, a line beginning ``*``
  is the next card, and a title of ``*Node`` followed by a row spelled the
  deck a vertex it never had. A line holding ``**`` goes for the same reason:
  the marker opens a comment anywhere on a line, so such a title came back
  truncated at it, or as nothing at all.

- An Abaqus ``*Heading`` line ending in a comma keeps the line below it. A
  trailing comma continues a data line onto the next one everywhere else in a
  deck, and a heading holds no data: the rule glued a title of ``turbine
  blade,`` to the ``rev 3`` under it, and the deck came back one line where
  its author had written two.

- An Abaqus ``*Surface, type=NODE`` row that a trailing comma joined onto the
  next reads a whole number after a set name as that set's weight factor
  rather than as a node of the surface. The join takes the line break with
  it, and the line break is what told the one from the other; a row opening
  with a node number is still a row of node numbers, which is the spelling
  the join exists to read.

- An element is written back as a ``*Surface`` row only when its own type is
  the one a face of that width names. A tetrahedron's four nodes can be
  exactly a hexahedron's face, and columns saying so passed the vertex check:
  the solid was written as a side of the hexahedron instead of as an element
  card, so the deck lost a volume element and handed back a quadrilateral.

- A ``*Surface`` row that would take the mesh past the connectivity safety cap
  is refused before its face is built rather than after, where a check that
  only counted what was already there let the mesh past the cap by a face's
  width.

- A binary PLY face declaring more vertices than the file holds - 2**31-1 of
  them - is refused with a ``CodecError`` naming the truncation, where the
  whole-block read used to build a record dtype for it first and hand back
  numpy's ``ValueError`` about a tuple shape, which named neither the file
  nor the face. Every other format's declared counts were swept for the same
  fault and are guarded; ``tests/test_declared_counts.py`` now holds one
  corrupt header per format as a matrix.

- ``.vti``, ``.vts`` and ``.vtr`` hold a grid, and each now says so when
  handed something else. All three inferred their extent from the distinct
  coordinate on each axis, and none of them checked that those multiply back
  out to the mesh: a scattered mesh of seven vertices was written as a seven by
  seven by seven grid of 343 points, with seven rows of point data under a
  header claiming 343. The file was unreadable - its own reader refused it -
  but nothing said so at the point of writing. A mesh whose vertices are a
  grid in some other order was worse, since the count agreed: the file was
  read back happily with every point attribute sitting on the point mirrored
  through the diagonal. The extent is now read off the cells instead, which
  are a grid whatever the coordinates do, and a mesh whose cells are not one
  raises ``CodecError`` naming the shape that was found and pointing at
  ``.vtu``, which holds an arbitrary mesh.
- None of the three writes its connectivity - the reader rebuilds it from the
  extent - and none of them checked that the cells it was handed were the ones
  it would rebuild. Two tetrahedra over the points of a grid were written as
  the grid's eight hexahedra, their ``CellData`` dropped on the way out for
  covering the wrong number of cells, and the mesh that came back was not the
  one that went in. Cells the extent does not read back now raise
  ``CodecError`` at the point of writing.
- ``.vts`` holds a curvilinear grid: it writes its points, so they need not
  lie on a lattice at all, and a warped block, a cylindrical shell and an
  aerofoil O-grid are all StructuredGrids. Taking the extent from the distinct
  coordinate on each axis meant none of them could be written - a warped 3x3x3
  grid counted 27 distinct values on every axis and went out declaring a
  27x27x27 one - and reading the extent off the cells is what lets the format
  hold what it is for.
- ``.vtr`` writes its three coordinate arrays out in full, so nothing says an
  axis has to ascend. They were taken as the sorted distinct value on each
  column, which turned a descending axis round underneath its own point data;
  they are read off the vertices a stride at a time now, and an axis keeps the
  direction it was given.
- ``.vti`` and ``.vts`` keep the extent of the file they were read from, and
  ``.vti`` the origin and step as well, so a grid that did not begin at zero -
  or that steps down an axis - goes back exactly where it stood. All three
  were trusted after a transform had moved the mesh out from under them, and
  each fails differently: a grid pruned to one of its cells was written under
  the extent of the grid it used to be and read back as twenty-seven vertices
  and eight cells it no longer held, a mesh moved five units went out under
  the origin it had left, and one scaled by ten went out under the step. What
  no longer describes the mesh is re-derived from it, the way the entity ids
  are re-checked at the point of writing rather than trusted.
- Writing ``.vti`` took the step on the x axis for the step on all three. A
  lattice whose planes are unevenly spaced is a RectilinearGrid, not an
  ImageData, and one written as the latter came back with every plane past the
  second moved - x coordinates of 0, 1 and 5 read back as 0, 1 and 2, in a
  well-formed file of the right size. An axis that is not evenly spaced now
  raises ``CodecError`` pointing at ``.vtr``, which spells its coordinates
  out.
- Reading back the empty ``.vts`` this codec writes raised ``ValueError:
  cannot reshape array of size 0 into shape (0,newaxis)``. An empty extent
  gives no column count to infer one from; a file with no points now reads
  as a mesh with none.
- Writing ``.vti`` measures the grid step on each axis separately. Only the
  x axis was asked whether it had a second plane to measure against, and y
  and z were then indexed regardless, so any mesh flat in one of them - a
  sheet of quads, an image one voxel deep - raised ``IndexError`` from inside
  the writer instead of being written, and a mesh flat in x quietly took the
  default spacing on all three axes rather than the steps it did have. A
  degenerate axis now keeps the default spacing, which is what VTK reads back
  for an extent of zero anyway, and a mesh with no vertices at all writes the
  ``0 -1`` extent VTK spells an empty image with - the one the ``.vts`` and
  ``.vtr`` writers here already spell - rather than the ``0 0`` that reads
  back as a point the mesh never held.
- Reading a ``.vti`` whose ``Origin`` or ``Spacing`` spells two numbers where
  three belong raised ``IndexError`` from inside the parse. The axes it does
  give are taken and the rest defaulted, and a bare number given as
  ``vti_spacing`` is taken for every axis rather than subscripted. Any number
  of them but three warns rather than passing in silence, and a short one is
  the worse of the two: a dropped fourth number describes no axis, where a
  missing third is an axis of the mesh given a value the file never spelled.
  This codec writes no coordinates, so those six numbers are the whole
  geometry.
- ``.vtr`` keeps the extent of the file it was read from, the way ``.vti`` and
  ``.vts`` do. A block that did not begin at zero was slid to the origin on the
  way out, which is the one thing a ``.pvtr`` assembling it next to its
  neighbours reads. It is checked against the mesh rather than trusted: one a
  transform has moved the mesh out from under is re-derived from the cells.
- All three keep the ``WholeExtent`` of the file they were read from as well
  as their own ``Extent``. The two differ exactly when the file is one piece
  of a parallel set, which is the case the piece indices are kept for, and
  writing the piece extent into both narrowed the grid to the piece: a block
  that went back out at the indices it stood on still claimed to be the whole
  domain, so the ``.pvti``, ``.pvts`` or ``.pvtr`` assembling it read one
  neighbour where it should have read several. Kept only while the piece
  extent is, since an extent re-derived from the cells is zero-based and says
  nothing about the grid the mesh used to stand in.
- A ``WholeExtent`` that is not six whole numbers now raises ``CodecError``
  naming the file and the attribute. Unpacked straight into ints, it failed
  with a bare ``ValueError`` about a literal instead.
- A ``.vti`` or ``.vtr`` holding a bare grid is readable by the codec that
  wrote it. Neither format spells a coordinate per vertex - an ImageData
  writes an origin and a step, a RectilinearGrid three axes - but the header
  check weighed the declared point count against the bytes on disk as though
  they did, so a plain 4x4x4 grid went out as a valid 231-byte file and came
  back as ``ValidationError: declared_n_verts=64 implies 1536 bytes of vertex
  data``. The heuristic is asked only of a format that spells what it
  declares.
- A format excused that heuristic is held to a tighter cap in its place. The
  heuristic is what made the loose one safe to leave loose: a format that
  writes its points has to spend bytes on each, so a header can only ask for
  as much memory as the file it sits in is long. An ImageData spends six
  indices on any number of points, so a 250-byte file could declare a hundred
  million planes on one axis and be expanded into the 2.4 GB of vertices they
  come to. The cap clears any grid that expands into a mesh a machine can
  work with and refuses the rest by name.
- Writing ``.vti`` spells its ``Origin`` and ``Spacing`` at the width a double
  reads back at. These six numbers are the whole geometry of an ImageData, and
  a ``.10g`` field kept ten of the seventeen a double carries: an origin of
  0.12345678901234 came back 2.6e-10 away and a step of 1.0000000001234 came
  back as a flat 1, moving every plane by one step more than the last. The
  writer had just checked the vertices against that origin and step to prove
  the file describes this mesh, and then wrote one that did not.
- The evenness an ``ImageData`` demands of an axis is measured against the
  step, not against the coordinate. A relative tolerance is a fraction of
  where the axis sits rather than of how far apart its planes are, so an axis
  at x = 1e6 was allowed half a millimetre of drift per plane: a visibly
  uneven lattice passed the check and came back regularised, with every plane
  past the second moved. A drift below what a double holds at that magnitude
  is still allowed, since no file could record it either way.
- An extent that ends before it starts on an axis holds no points, so it holds
  no cells either. All three readers counted the other two axes' cells anyway,
  so ``0 -1 0 2 0 2`` came back as four quadrilaterals over no vertices at all,
  every corner naming point zero of an empty array. An end two or more before
  its start turned the point count negative on top of that, which ``.vts`` then
  handed to ``reshape`` as a second unknown dimension. Such an extent now reads
  as the empty mesh it describes. Legacy ``.vtk`` says the same thing with
  ``DIMENSIONS`` and had the same hole: a ``STRUCTURED_POINTS`` or
  ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` of ``0 3 3`` came back as four quadrilaterals over no
  vertices, built from strides that were themselves zero, and a negative
  ``DIMENSIONS`` was reported to the caller as a negative count of points.
- The extent a mesh carries in ``global_attrs`` may be no extent at all. A
  bare number has no length and a string that looks like one has characters
  rather than numbers, and either reached ``len`` and failed with a
  ``TypeError`` from inside the ``.vti``, ``.vts`` or ``.vtr`` writer. So could
  a ``vti_origin`` or ``vti_spacing`` holding something no float reads. None
  of them is trusted now: what cannot be read is named in a warning and the
  writer reads the mesh's own extent, origin and step off it instead.
- ``.vtr`` builds its vertices from the coordinate arrays and everything else
  from the extent, and nothing in the file made the two agree. An array longer
  than its axis expanded into more vertices than the extent declared, while the
  cells, the offsets and every ``PointData`` array stayed sized to the extent -
  a mesh whose connectivity covered part of itself and whose attributes covered
  none of it, past every check the reader made. The lengths are compared now,
  and a mismatch raises ``CodecError`` naming the axis. Every axis is asked,
  including one the extent gives no plane at all: the point count is a product
  and goes to zero there, but the vertices are the coordinate arrays' own outer
  product, so an axis left unchecked expanded ``0 -1 0 2 0 2`` into nine
  vertices under an extent declaring none. An axis the file leaves no array for
  takes the one plane at zero the extent gives it, which is how a
  two-dimensional grid writes its third.
- ``.vts`` reads the width of its points from the extent and the ``<Points>``
  array together, so a file whose two disagreed came back as a mesh of the
  wrong width - one point of no coordinates at all, where the extent declared a
  point the array did not carry - and only failed later, on a shape nothing in
  the file explained. Both counts are named in a ``CodecError`` now. An array
  wider than three components still keeps its first three.
- An MFEM file that opens with a byte order mark is read rather than refused.
  The sniffer decodes the mark away and the reader did not, and the mark is
  not whitespace for ``strip`` to take off, so a ``.mesh`` the registry had
  already claimed as MFEM failed for not starting with ``MFEM mesh``.
- Every spelling of an MFEM header the sniffer accepts is one the reader
  dispatches on. The registry claims a ``.mesh`` file by its upper-cased
  header and the reader matched case-sensitively, so ``MFEM NC MESH v1.0`` was
  claimed as MFEM and then refused for not starting with ``MFEM mesh``. The two
  NC spellings both reach the non-conforming reader as well: ``MFEM NC-Mesh``
  was falling through to the NURBS one, which read a refinement forest as
  B-spline control points and warned under the wrong variant's name.
- ``.meshb`` hands back vertices with three columns. A file declaring
  ``Dimension 2`` was read into an ``(n, 2)`` array, which is not what a
  ``PolyData`` holds: every consumer indexing ``vertices[:, 2]`` - the
  transforms, the other writers, ``faces`` - raised on it. The coordinates
  are padded with ``z=0`` like every other codec's, and the write side takes
  its ``Dimension`` from the mesh rather than from the width of the array.
- A tag group naming a vertex or an element that this mesh does not have no
  longer moves the label onto one that it does. ``remove_orphan_vertices``,
  ``merge_duplicate_vertices`` and ``filter_element_type`` carried a group
  through their index remap after dropping only the members past the end, so
  a negative index reached the array from the far end and landed on a real
  item, and a group holding floats - which nothing stops a reader from
  building - raised ``IndexError`` from inside numpy instead. All three now
  go through the same member check the writers use: a member that indexes
  nothing in this mesh is dropped, and what is left is remapped.
- The documented ``pipeline(filter_element_type(keep="triangle"), ...)``
  raised ``TypeError``: ``filter_element_type`` takes the mesh first and does
  not curry. The example now composes it with ``functools.partial``.
- A broken binary file now reports what is wrong with it rather than
  ``BufferError: cannot close exported pointers exist``. The formats that
  parse over a mapping - ``.ply``, legacy ``.vtk``, ``.meshb`` - build their
  arrays as views of it, and a parse that gives up half-way leaves one of
  those alive in the traceback carrying the failure; unmapping underneath it
  then raised, and that error replaced the codec's own. The mapping is left
  to the last view of it instead, so a corrupt file says the same thing read
  from a path as it does read from a buffer, where there was never a mapping
  to unmap.
- A source that answers a read with less than it was asked for is now read to
  the end of the request. A bare ``read`` is allowed to come up short - a
  socket hands back what has arrived, not what was wanted - and the wrapper
  put in front of a duck-typed handle passed that straight through, so a
  codec asking for n bytes could silently get fewer and parse the gap as
  data. A handle from ``open()`` never came up short, so no codec guarded
  against it. Nothing is read past what was asked for, so a handle the caller
  shares still ends up where the codec's reading left it.
- OBJ face indices are resolved the way the format defines them: a negative
  index counts back from what has been declared so far, and an index naming
  a record the file does not have raises ``CodecError`` naming the line
  instead of wrapping around into a different vertex.
- OBJ ``vt`` records are read. They are indexed per face corner, so a file
  may hold more of them than it holds vertices; each corner assigns to its
  vertex, a vertex given two different values keeps the last and warns, and
  records nothing indexes are kept only when there is one per vertex.
  ``vt`` and ``vn`` are written back, so texture coordinates and normals
  survive a round trip.
- OBJ writes a bare ``g`` before a face that belongs to no group, so it no
  longer inherits the group of the face above it, and a bare ``g`` on read
  clears the active groups rather than inventing a ``default`` tag.
- An OBJ file whose ``vn`` or ``vt`` records cannot be lined up with its
  vertices now leaves the attribute out. The fold that gives up returned
  None, and only the ``vt`` path checked for it, so ``vertex_attrs`` could
  hand back a None where an array belongs and the writer raised
  ``TypeError`` on it.
- OBJ writes a number where a vertex has no record. A vertex no face names
  carries NaN out of the reader, and ``vt nan nan`` is not a record another
  reader takes; the row nothing indexes is written as zero. A ``vt`` array
  narrower than two columns is padded rather than indexed past its end.
- OBJ leaves out a ``vn`` or ``vt`` attribute that does not hold one row
  per vertex, with a warning naming its shape. Only the column count was
  checked, so an attribute with fewer rows than the mesh wrote faces
  indexing ``vt`` records that were not in the file - which no reader can
  take, this one included: a three-vertex mesh carrying one texture
  coordinate wrote a file that read back as ``CodecError``. A
  one-dimensional attribute is now read as one value per vertex rather
  than as a single row.
- Legacy ``.vtk`` files now read ``COLOR_SCALARS`` and ``NORMALS``, in both
  the ASCII and the binary flavour. Both used to stop the attribute scan,
  dropping the array and everything after it without a word. A binary
  ``COLOR_SCALARS`` component is an unsigned char standing for the 0..1
  float an ASCII file writes, and is scaled onto that range, so the same
  colour reads back the same from either flavour.
- Legacy ``.vtk`` reads ``TEXTURE_COORDINATES``, and steps over a
  ``LOOKUP_TABLE`` definition rather than stopping at it. Those were the
  last two attribute keywords the format defines that the scan did not
  know, and in a binary file an unknown keyword ends the scan: a file
  carrying either lost every array after it. A palette is not a value per
  point, so a lookup table becomes no attribute - it is only counted past.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` attribute keyword the reader does not know now warns
  that it and everything after it in that section are being dropped. Its
  payload is binary of unknown length, so the scan still cannot go on, but
  a short read is no longer a silent one.
- ``NORMALS`` and ``COLOR_SCALARS`` are read from ``STRUCTURED_POINTS``,
  ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` and ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` files too. Those three
  datasets scan their attributes themselves rather than through the shared
  parser, and knew only ``SCALARS``, ``VECTORS`` and ``FIELD``.
- A binary legacy ``.vtk`` attribute that runs past the end of the file now
  raises ``CodecError`` naming the array and the bytes that are missing.
  The slice came up short in silence and the reshape after it failed with
  a ``ValueError`` naming neither the array nor the file.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` attribute section that declares more values than the
  file holds raises ``CodecError`` naming the array and the count, rather
  than running off the end of the line list with an ``IndexError`` that
  names nothing. This covers ``SCALARS``, ``COLOR_SCALARS``, ``VECTORS``,
  ``NORMALS``, ``TENSORS`` and ``FIELD``.
- A Nastran real field is now written in whatever spelling fits it. Bulk
  data allows the exponent's ``E`` to be dropped when its sign is there
  (``1.234-10``), and nothing reads ``+07`` differently from ``+7``, so the
  writer offers both - three columns back on the explicit form, which is
  three more significant digits in an eight-column field. A value at the
  top of the double range is stepped one digit toward zero rather than
  refused, since rounding it to nearest overflows to infinity. No finite
  coordinate is refused by a field any more.
- A Nastran real field prefers a spelling that reads back as the value it
  was given. The search spent precision one digit at a time and took the
  first form that fit, so a mantissa stepped toward zero could win a field
  an exact form two digits shorter would also have fit: ``1e7`` went out as
  ``9999999.`` where ``1.E+07`` was available, and ``1e15`` as
  ``999999999999999.`` in a large field. Exact spellings are now swept for
  first, at every precision, and only a value no field can hold exactly -
  the top of the double range - falls through to the closest one.
- The XML writers declare ``version="1.0"`` in the ``<VTKFile>`` header
  rather than ``version="0.1"``, which no VTK release ever defined.
  Reading a file that declares ``0.1`` is unchanged.
- A ``<DataArray>`` polyxios cannot decode - a ``type="String"`` label
  array, or any type it does not know - is skipped with a warning naming
  it, and the arrays around it are still read. It used to vanish without
  a word.
- A legacy ``STRUCTURED_POINTS`` file keeps its ``DIMENSIONS``, ``ORIGIN``
  and ``SPACING`` in ``global_attrs`` as ``vtk_dimensions`` /
  ``vtk_origin`` / ``vtk_spacing``, and ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` /
  ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` keep their ``DIMENSIONS``. Expanding the header into
  a point array used to throw the grid away.
- A ``.vtu`` or ``.vtp`` ``Piece`` that declares points and does not
  deliver them raises ``CodecError``, whether its ``<Points>`` element is
  short or missing altogether. It used to be skipped, leaving the piece's
  cells indexing points that are not there and every later piece shifted
  by the count that never arrived.
- A point or cell array that covers only some of a multi-piece ``.vtu`` or
  ``.vtp`` file is dropped with a warning naming it. Joining the pieces
  that carried it gave an array shorter than the mesh, whose rows then sat
  against the wrong points from the second piece on. An array the pieces
  shape differently - one calling it scalar and the next a vector - is
  dropped the same way, with its shapes named, rather than raising a bare
  ``ValueError`` from ``numpy.concatenate``.
- A ``CELL_DATA`` section is read from ``STRUCTURED_POINTS``,
  ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` and ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` files. Those three walk
  their own attributes, and the chain that did it asked only about points,
  so every cell array fell past it in silence - the cell scalars in VTK's
  own ``SampleStructGrid.vtk`` among them. The three now share one scanner,
  which also gives them ``TEXTURE_COORDINATES`` and ``TENSORS``. An array
  whose declared length matches neither the points nor the cells is dropped
  with a warning rather than reaching ``PolyData`` as a validation error
  about lengths.
- A structured legacy ``.vtk`` grid extends along whichever axes it
  declares. A ``DIMENSIONS 3 1 3`` sheet was read as two lines over the
  first two points instead of four quads over all nine, and a column along
  ``y`` or ``z`` was read with the stride of a row along ``x``. Only grids
  flat in ``z`` and rows along ``x`` came out right.
- An attribute keyword one of the structured readers does not handle now
  warns that its array is being dropped, the way the shared parser's binary
  scan already did. Skipping the line does not step over the payload, so in
  a binary file the scan carries on inside it.
- An unknown attribute keyword in an ASCII legacy ``.vtk`` file warns as
  well. Only the binary scan said anything; ASCII skipped the keyword and
  its value lines without a word.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` attribute section whose values run into the next
  header raises ``CodecError`` naming the array, the line and what it
  holds, rather than ``float()`` answering with a bare ``ValueError`` that
  names neither the array nor the file.
- A binary attribute in a structured legacy ``.vtk`` file is checked
  against the end of the file before it is sliced, which the shared parser
  already did. A truncated file gave a nameless reshape ``ValueError``.
- A ``.vtu`` or ``.vtp`` ``Points`` array whose size is not a whole number
  of tuples per point raises ``CodecError`` naming the Piece. Only a short
  array was caught, so ten values for three points reached ``reshape`` and
  came back as a ``ValueError`` naming neither the file nor the Piece.
- A ``v``, ``vn`` or ``vt`` record in an OBJ file that does not carry the
  components its directive needs, or carries something that is not a
  number, raises ``CodecError`` naming the line. Both used to reach the
  caller as a bare ``IndexError`` or ``ValueError``. A ``vt`` carrying a
  third component - the depth of a volumetric texture - keeps the two a
  surface uses rather than making the records ragged.
- Writing an OBJ ``vertex_attrs`` entry that holds no numbers - a label per
  vertex, say - drops it with a warning instead of raising out of
  ``numpy.asarray``.
- Legacy ``.vtk`` files written by VTK 5.1 - the default since VTK 9.0 -
  are read. The two numbers on a v5.1 ``CELLS`` line are the length of the
  ``OFFSETS`` array and the length of ``CONNECTIVITY``, not the cell count;
  reading the first as a cell count ran the offsets into the
  ``CONNECTIVITY`` keyword and answered with a bare ``ValueError``. The
  offsets are now counted up to that keyword, so files spelling the line
  either way are read. ``POLYDATA`` gained the layout altogether: its
  ``POLYGONS``, ``LINES``, ``VERTICES`` and ``TRIANGLE_STRIPS`` sections
  knew only the v4.2 form, so no polydata file VTK 9 writes could be read
  at all.
- Writing a v5.1 legacy ``.vtk`` file declares the length of its
  ``OFFSETS`` array on the ``CELLS`` line. It declared the cell count,
  which VTK's own reader takes literally: it stopped with "Error reading
  cell array connectivity header" and returned a mesh with no cells.
  Files polyxios wrote before this still read.
- A ``METADATA`` block is stepped over. Every VTK writer since 4.2 puts one
  after each array, and it is text even in a binary file. In ASCII it
  warned twice about keywords it named as dropped; in binary it ended the
  attribute scan, so a file with two arrays came back with one. Inside a
  ``FIELD`` block it was read as an array header, which took the array
  after it with it.
- A binary ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` keeps the section that follows its points.
  The line cursor was stepped past the payload and then once more over the
  newline that ended it, so whichever section came next - a ``CELL_DATA``
  written before ``POINT_DATA``, as VTK writes it - was skipped.
- A ``RECTILINEAR_GRID`` follows its coordinate arrays rather than its
  ``DIMENSIONS`` header. The points are the outer product of the three
  arrays, so a header that disagreed with them generated cells indexing
  points that do not exist and dropped attributes that covered every point
  there is. The header is now checked against them, warned about when it
  differs, and the arrays win.
- ``.vti``, ``.vts`` and ``.vtr`` honour ``NumberOfComponents`` when
  reading an attribute. A three-component array on 27 points came back as
  81 rows, which belongs to no mesh and fails ``validate``; ``.vtu`` and
  ``.vtp`` of the same family already cut it into tuples.
- ``.vtr`` declares the component count of the attributes it writes, so a
  vector survives a round trip, and writes each array in the type its
  ``<DataArray>`` declares. Everything was cast to float64 under whatever
  header the original dtype produced, so an ``Int32`` attribute read back
  as the bit pattern of a double.
- A ``.vtu`` or ``.vtp`` ``Points`` array of a type that holds no numbers -
  ``type="String"``, or any type this reader does not know - raises
  ``CodecError`` naming the type. It warned that the array was skipped and
  then blamed the point count for the zero values that left.
- A ``.vtr`` attribute of a dtype no VTK type names - a boolean mask, a
  float16 - is written as the ``Float64`` its header declares. Only the
  header fell back; the bytes stayed the dtype's own, so eight booleans
  went out as eight bytes under a ``Float64`` header and read back as one
  garbage double.
- Every XML writer declares the whole width of a tuple, not the second
  dimension of the array holding it. A ``(n, 3, 3)`` tensor attribute -
  what a legacy ``TENSORS`` section reads back as - was declared as one
  component in ``.vti``, ``.vts``, ``.vtp`` and ``.vtu`` and as three in
  ``.vtr``, so nine times the rows came back and belonged to no mesh.
- The XML writers cast to little endian before taking the bytes, which is
  what the ``byte_order`` they all declare says those bytes are. On a
  big-endian machine every binary array went out reversed.
- ``.vti``, ``.vts`` and ``.vtr`` drop an attribute whose rows cannot be
  matched to the mesh, with a warning naming it, as ``.vtu`` and ``.vtp``
  already did. It used to reach ``PolyData`` and fail ``validate`` with a
  message about lengths rather than about the file.
- A binary legacy ``.vtk`` file holds its ``TENSORS`` as binary. Both
  tensor branches of the writer - the 3x3 one and the Voigt 6-component
  one - spelled their numbers whatever was asked for, so a binary file
  carrying either had a run of ASCII in the middle of it and came back as
  a ``CodecError`` about a short block.
- The ASCII writers spell a value as the shortest decimal that reads back
  as it, rather than to ten significant digits. A legacy ``.vtk``,
  ``.vti``, ``.vts``, ``.vtp`` or ``.vtr`` file declaring ``double`` or
  ``Float64`` held seven digits fewer than that, so coordinates came back
  about 1e-10 off what was written; they are now exact.
- A ``METADATA`` block written without its blank terminator ends at the
  geometry keyword after it as well as at an attribute one. Left open at
  the end of a ``POINT_DATA`` section it swallowed the ``CELLS`` that
  followed and every line to the end of the file - the failure the
  terminator search was added to prevent.
- A malformed attribute section in a structured legacy ``.vtk`` file costs
  the section rather than the mesh. A count running past the end of the
  file raised ``CodecError`` out of a read whose geometry was already
  whole, and those sections were skipped entirely before they were read at
  all, so files that used to load stopped loading.
- A ``.vtu`` or ``.vtp`` ``Piece`` that cannot be read is named by its
  index. A file of forty pieces gave no way to find the one at fault.
- An OBJ vertex named twice with different values is warned about whichever
  component they differ in. The check asked whether the first component had
  been written yet, so a record whose first component is NaN hid every
  conflict on that vertex.
- Writing an OBJ ``vn`` or ``vt`` attribute wider than the record says how
  many components are being left out, rather than truncating in silence.
- A legacy ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` whose ``DIMENSIONS`` does not cover its
  ``POINTS`` array hands the points back without cells, warning about the
  two counts. The cells are strides through the layout the header
  describes, so a header naming more points than the file delivered
  generated connectivity indexing points that are not there: the read
  returned a ``PolyData`` that fails ``validate``. ``RECTILINEAR_GRID``
  already reconciled the two.
- An attribute section is read by the count its own header declares rather
  than by the count of the mesh. The two agree in a well-formed file, and
  where they do not the section's is the only number that says where one
  array ends and the next begins - reading by the mesh's walked an array
  straight into the header after it. An array that then covers no point or
  cell of the mesh is dropped with a warning naming it, as the structured
  readers already did.
- A binary legacy ``.vtk`` ``SCALARS`` section without a ``LOOKUP_TABLE``
  line - which the format leaves optional - reads its own values. The line
  was consumed unconditionally, so the payload up to its first ``0x0a``
  byte was swallowed, and a payload holding none rewound the scan to the
  top of the file.
- A binary legacy ``.vtk`` ``POINTS``, ``CELLS`` or ``CELL_TYPES`` block is
  checked against the end of the file before it is sliced, the way the
  attribute blocks already were. The whole-file bound the header check
  applies clears a block that still runs off the end - a file with a long
  comment header, say - and the reshape after the short slice failed with a
  ``ValueError`` naming neither the array nor the file.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` attribute header missing a field, or spelling a count
  as something that is not a number, names the file and the line it is on.
  ``SCALARS`` with no array name reached the caller as ``IndexError: list
  index out of range`` and ``SCALARS s float x`` as a bare ``ValueError``,
  in the ASCII scan, the binary scan and the structured one alike. A binary
  file has no line to name, so the byte offset stands in for one.
- ``.vti``, ``.vts``, ``.vtp`` and ``.vtu`` write each attribute in the
  type the array is held in, as ``.vtr`` does. Everything was cast to a
  double under a ``Float64`` header, so an ``int64`` identifier past 2**53
  came back a different number.
- The ASCII body of a ``<DataArray>`` is parsed into the type the element
  declares rather than through ``float()`` first. An ``Int64`` array was
  rounded to a double before the declared type ever saw it, which the top
  of the integer range does not survive.
- A binary legacy ``.vtk`` block is read as the type its header names. A
  ``POINTS n int`` was read at four bytes a float, so an integer point
  array came back as coordinates the file never held, and a type name the
  reader has no numpy equivalent for - ``bit``, or a misspelling - was
  guessed at rather than refused. Every binary header now resolves its type
  the same way and raises ``CodecError`` naming it when it cannot; the
  names VTK writes for 64-bit and signed-char arrays were missing from the
  table and are there now. An ASCII payload is unaffected: its values are
  text whatever the header calls them.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` geometry or section header spelling a count as
  something that is not a number, or leaving it out, names the file and the
  line it is on. ``POINTS``, ``CELLS``, ``CELL_TYPES``, ``POINT_DATA``,
  ``CELL_DATA``, ``DIMENSIONS``, ``ORIGIN``, ``SPACING`` and the coordinate
  arrays reached the caller as a bare ``ValueError`` or ``IndexError``,
  which the attribute headers had already stopped doing.
- A ``CELL_DATA`` array in a legacy ``STRUCTURED_GRID`` is measured against
  the cells the mesh ends up with rather than the cells ``DIMENSIONS``
  describes. A header its ``POINTS`` array does not cover leaves the mesh
  with no cells, and the array was kept against the header's count, so the
  read returned a ``PolyData`` that fails ``validate``.
- An OBJ face index spelled with a superscript digit raises ``CodecError``
  naming the line. ``str.isdigit`` admits ``²`` and ``int()`` then refuses
  it, so the fast path let a bare ``ValueError`` out; the test is now
  ``str.isdecimal``, which still admits the non-Latin digits ``int()``
  reads.
- A bare ``mtllib`` or ``o`` directive in an OBJ file names nothing rather
  than the empty string, which used to be written back as a directive with
  nothing after it.
- Writing an OBJ ``element_attrs['material']`` that does not cover the
  faces drops it with a warning naming its length, the way the vertex
  attributes already were. Indexed per face it ran off the end partway
  through, leaving a half-written file and an ``IndexError`` naming an
  axis.
- A ``.vtu`` or ``.vtp`` ``Piece`` whose ``NumberOfPoints`` is not a count,
  and a ``.vti``, ``.vts`` or ``.vtr`` ``Extent`` that is not six whole
  numbers, raise ``CodecError`` naming the file. They reached the caller as
  a bare ``ValueError`` about ``int()`` or about unpacking.
- A ``<DataArray>`` whose ``NumberOfComponents`` is not a count is read
  flat with a warning naming it, rather than raising a bare ``ValueError``
  from ``int()``.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` file whose header declares ``DATASET FIELD`` is read.
  The dispatch asked what the line starts with while the line still
  carried its ``DATASET`` keyword, so the branch never ran and every field
  data file was refused by the one below it.
- A ``METADATA`` block inside a v5.1 ``CELLS`` section is stepped over. VTK
  follows a cell array with one, so a block sat between the offsets and the
  connectivity of files every release since 9.0 writes; read as offsets it
  raised ``CodecError`` about a line of words where numbers belong.
- A v5.1 ``CELLS`` section is found by what follows the header rather than
  by the version in the first line. Versions were compared as strings, so a
  file declaring ``10.0`` sorted below ``5.1`` and its offsets would have
  been read as a v4.2 cell stream. The binary scan already asked this way.
- A ``.vti``, ``.vts`` or ``.vtr`` extent flat along an axis - an image one
  voxel deep - is a sheet of quads, or a run of lines when it is flat along
  two. All three read it as a grid of no cells, which left every
  ``CellData`` array belonging to nothing.
- An ASCII ``<DataArray>`` holding a value its declared type is too narrow
  for wraps with a warning naming the array, the way a C reader wraps it,
  rather than escaping as a bare ``OverflowError`` from numpy. A token that
  names no number at all raises ``CodecError`` naming the array.
- Writing a point or cell attribute of a kind no ``<DataArray>`` can hold -
  a label per vertex, say - raises ``CodecError`` naming the array and its
  dtype, rather than a ``ValueError`` about one element.
- The warnings the ``.vtk``, XML and OBJ codecs raise are blamed on the code
  that asked for the file. Every one of them pointed a frame short, at
  ``polyxios.read`` or ``polyxios.write`` itself, which tells a caller
  nothing about which of their own calls found the file.

Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A legacy ``.vtk`` write no longer builds the whole of a mesh as one string
  or one array before writing it. Every block is written in runs, so the
  bytes are the ones a single join produced while the memory a write holds
  above the mesh is a fixed run whatever the mesh's size. A run of cells
  that share a node count - which is every mesh of one element type - is
  laid out as rows of an array rather than a cell at a time, and both
  spellings share that layout. ``CELL_TYPES`` is translated by indexing a
  table built once at import rather than by a dictionary hop per cell.
  Writing 400k triangles: spelled, 923 ms and 54 MB above the
  mesh became 431 ms and 6 MB; binary, 564 ms and 128 MB became 15 ms and
  10 MB.

- Reading an OBJ file resolves a face corner inline when it names a plain
  index inside what has been declared, which is what nearly every corner
  does; the rest still go the long way round, where the message naming the
  line lives. A mesh of any size has millions of corners, and the call this
  saves is most of what checking them cost. A ``v``, ``vn`` or ``vt`` record
  carrying exactly the components its directive spells skips the padding and
  the slice that feeds it.
- A ``float32`` attribute is spelled at its own width in an ASCII
  ``<DataArray>``. Widened to a double first, ``0.1`` went out as
  ``0.10000000149011612`` - seventeen digits of a value carrying seven -
  which is nearly twice the file for the same numbers.
- Writing a Nastran large-field deck is roughly ten times faster. Sweeping
  for an exact spelling asked every precision from seventeen digits down,
  spelling and parsing candidates at each; rounding to fewer significant
  digits than ``repr`` carries cannot be exact whatever form it takes, so
  the sweep now stops there. Neither sweep spells a candidate at a
  precision the field could not hold in the first place, and the stepped
  mantissas - the expensive half - are built only when the rounded ones
  have all missed. Twenty thousand ``GRID*`` cards went from 10.3 s to
  1.0 s, and every value is written exactly as before.
- Reading an OBJ file no longer names its source once per line. The name
  costs a path walk and was only ever used to spell an error message.
- A Nastran real field below one drops its leading zero when the column it
  costs is a significant digit. Bulk data reads ``.5`` as ``0.5``, so a
  third in an eight-column field goes out as ``.3333333`` rather than
  ``0.333333``.
- Writing an OBJ file looks its material attribute up once rather than once
  per face.
- Stepping past a binary payload in a structured legacy ``.vtk`` file is a
  binary search over the line offsets rather than a walk. A binary payload
  carries a newline every few values, so the lines it is cut into number in
  the thousands for a grid of any size; a 5 MB ``STRUCTURED_POINTS`` file
  reads about a fifth faster.
- ``.vti``, ``.vts`` and ``.vtr`` build their hexahedra with array
  arithmetic instead of a Python loop per cell. The corners of a cell are
  strides from its own origin, so the whole connectivity is eight adds over
  the origins; a 40x40x40 grid builds about nine times faster.
- The structured legacy ``.vtk`` readers cut their file into lines in one
  pass rather than a ``find`` per line, and they all do it in the same
  place. The lines are byte-identical to what the walk produced.
- Folding OBJ ``vt`` and ``vn`` records onto their vertices is one pass over
  the corners rather than a numpy row assignment per corner.
- A legacy ``.vtk`` ASCII payload is spelled and written in one pass instead
  of a formatted write per point, which was a syscall per line.

Tests
~~~~~

- Regression tests for the dtype a ``.vtr`` header declares against the
  bytes under it, the component count of a tensor attribute in every XML
  writer, a binary legacy ``TENSORS`` section, an unterminated ``METADATA``
  block followed by geometry, an attribute section declaring more than its
  file holds, an OBJ conflict hiding behind a NaN first component, and the
  ``Piece`` index in a ``.vtu`` error.
- ``test_a_double_section_holds_every_digit_of_a_double`` writes a
  coordinate no ten-digit spelling can hold and asks for it back unchanged.

- ``test_a_power_of_ten_is_written_exactly`` spells its powers as literals
  rather than computing them with ``**``. ``pow`` is not correctly rounded
  everywhere - glibc and MSVC answer ``10.0 ** 23`` with the double one unit
  above ``1e23``, macOS with ``1e23`` itself - and that neighbour needs
  seventeen significant digits, which no eight or sixteen character field
  can hold. The test asked the writer for a field wider than the format has,
  and failed on Linux and Windows only.
- A cross-codec round-trip matrix (``tests/test_roundtrip.py``) writes and
  re-reads five canonical meshes through every writable codec, checked
  against a table declaring exactly what each format keeps. A new codec
  cannot join the registry without an entry.

.. _changes_0.3.0:

0.3.0 (2026-08-18)
------------------

Fifteen new mesh formats, a real command line interface and a versioned
documentation site.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fifteen new codecs, taking the registry from 16 to 34 recognised
  extensions:

  - Abaqus ``.inp`` (C3D4 / C3D8 / S3 / S4 and friends).
  - AVS-UCD ``.avs``, preserving ``mat_id``.
  - DOLFIN / FEniCS XML ``.xml``.
  - FLAC3D ``.f3grid`` (zones and faces).
  - Gmsh ``.msh`` - ASCII v2 read/write, v4.1 read, physical groups kept.
  - Medit binary ``.meshb`` (GmfLib v1 and v2, zero-copy mmap).
  - Nastran ``.bdf``, also registered for ``.nas`` and ``.fem``, reading
    free, small and large field formats.
  - Netgen ``.vol`` (points, edges, faces, cells, tags).
  - OFF ``.off`` (ASCII and binary, colours, normals, texture coordinates).
  - STL ``.stl`` (binary and ASCII, lazy loading for binary).
  - SU2 ``.su2`` (VTK element codes, boundary markers).
  - Tecplot ``.tec`` (ASCII FE zone, POINT and BLOCK ordering).
  - TetGen ``.node`` + ``.ele`` pairs (markers, regions).
  - UGRID ``.ugrid`` (AFLR ASCII, boundary tags).
  - WKT ``.wkt`` (Well-Known Text).

- ``pxios`` command line interface with ``fetch``, ``list``, ``convert`` and
  ``viz`` subcommands. Visualization requires the optional ``viz`` extra
  (``pip install polyxios[viz]``).
- ``polyxios.read_polydata`` and ``polyxios.visualize_mesh`` helpers, plus
  ``polyxios.supported_extensions`` to introspect the codec registry.
- Versioned documentation at https://polyxios.org, with a version switcher,
  a credits page generated from the git history, and a page per format.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- The fetcher now resolves assets through a remote ``models.json`` catalog and
  downloads files individually, instead of pinned per-format release zips.
  Downloads are checksum-verified and the result is cached across runs; set
  ``POLYXIOS_MODELS_URL`` to pin the catalog to an immutable URL.
- ``pxios fetch`` gained ``--verbose``, requires a ``sha256`` for every asset
  and resolves destination paths defensively.
- ASCII writing is vectorised, and the docs build now treats Sphinx warnings
  as errors.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fetcher: rejected zip-slip paths, non-HTTPS URLs and stale cache entries,
  added timeouts, retried dropped transfers, and stopped ``example --list``
  from downloading the whole pack.
- STL: fixed a file-descriptor leak, ASCII decoding, lazy-format detection,
  trailing-data handling and zero normals on degenerate triangles.
- WKT: fixed ring grouping, decoding and degenerate rings, and hardened
  parsing and hole encoding.
- Gmsh: corrected the element type codes.
- Nastran: fixed marker parsing, exponent handling and write precision.
- ``resolve()`` now accepts a dotless ``fmt`` override.
- Fixed multi-channel vertex attributes in ``merge`` and ``vertex_colors``,
  offset validation and ASCII newlines in the VTK XML path, and restored
  multiblock partial loading and visualization colours.
