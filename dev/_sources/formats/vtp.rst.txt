VTK PolyData
============

.. rst-class:: px-badges

``.vtp`` ``read + write`` ``eager``

Summary of the specification
----------------------------

``.vtp`` is the VTK XML format for surface and curve geometry. A ``<Piece>`` declares its point and cell counts as attributes, then carries ``<Points>`` plus up to four cell containers - ``<Verts>``, ``<Lines>``, ``<Strips>`` and ``<Polys>`` - each expressed as a ``connectivity`` array and an ``offsets`` array rather than the legacy size-prefixed lists. Attributes travel in ``<PointData>`` and ``<CellData>`` with the same inline, base64 or appended storage choices as the other XML formats.

Reading
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import polyxios as px

    mesh = px.read("model.vtp")
    mesh.vertices          # (n, 3)
    mesh.element_types     # element groups found in the file

Writing
-------

.. code-block:: python

    px.write(mesh, "out.vtp")

This codec takes no format-specific options.

Quirks worth knowing
--------------------

.. rst-class:: px-quirks

- A tag group has no set of its own in this format, so it travels as one ``PointData`` or ``CellData`` column of ones and zeros named ``polyxios_tag_<group>``. An entity in two groups is named by both columns, which a format spelling one reference per entity cannot say. On the way in, a column with that name holding whole numbers is read back as the group; one holding anything else stays an attribute, since a member rounded into place names the wrong entity.
- ``<FieldData>`` is the mesh's own metadata rather than any point's or cell's: it is read from the dataset element and from a ``<Piece>`` alike, and written back from ``global_attrs``. A key both levels spell is the dataset's, which is the file's own answer for the mesh where a piece's is one piece's. The block holds arrays and nothing else, so a scalar written from one comes back as a one-element array, and every axis past the first is a component.
- ``<FieldData>`` holds a ``String`` array beside its numeric ones, so a ``global_attrs`` value that is text - a name, a title, a solver's own label - is written as one and comes back the string it was; a list of strings is one array of several tuples. A value that is neither numbers nor text - a mapping, a ragged list - is dropped with a warning naming the key.
- Triangle strips are expanded into individual triangles on read; writing emits polygons rather than re-striping.
- Each cell container becomes its own element group, so lines and polygons in one file stay distinguishable.
- A piece that declares points and does not deliver them raises :class:`~polyxios.exceptions.CodecError`; its cells would index points that are not there, and every later piece would be shifted by the count that never arrived.
- A point or cell array carried by only some of the pieces is dropped with a warning: joined short, its rows would sit against the wrong points from the second piece on.
- A ``Points`` array of a type that holds no numbers - ``type="String"``, or any type this reader does not know - raises :class:`~polyxios.exceptions.CodecError` naming the type.
- Attributes are written in the type their array is held in, so an integer identifier keeps every digit rather than being rounded through a double.
- ``lazy=True`` raises :class:`~polyxios.exceptions.LazyReadError`; the payload may be compressed or base64-encoded, neither of which can be memory-mapped.
