VTK PolyData
============

.. rst-class:: px-badges

``.vtp`` ``read + write`` ``eager``

Summary of the specification
----------------------------

``.vtp`` is the VTK XML format for surface and curve geometry. A ``<Piece>`` declares its point and cell counts as attributes, then carries ``<Points>`` plus up to four cell containers — ``<Verts>``, ``<Lines>``, ``<Strips>`` and ``<Polys>`` — each expressed as a ``connectivity`` array and an ``offsets`` array rather than the legacy size-prefixed lists. Attributes travel in ``<PointData>`` and ``<CellData>`` with the same inline, base64 or appended storage choices as the other XML formats.

Reading
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import polyxios as px

    mesh = px.read("model.vtp")
    mesh.vertices          # (n, 3)
    mesh.element_types     # element groups found in the file

Writing
-------

.. code-block:: python

    px.write(mesh, "out.vtp")

This codec takes no format-specific options.

Quirks worth knowing
--------------------

.. rst-class:: px-quirks

- Triangle strips are expanded into individual triangles on read; writing emits polygons rather than re-striping.
- Each cell container becomes its own element group, so lines and polygons in one file stay distinguishable.
