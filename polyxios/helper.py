    ``read`` hands back one mesh, always - a function that sometimes returns a

        index contributes one, its own blocks merged, since at that depth
        there is nothing to tell a block of a mesh from a mesh.

    Raises
    ------

    ``read`` hands back one mesh, always, so a file holding a mesh at several
    times is read at one of them - the first, or the ``step=`` asked for. The
    whole series is read here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path
        An ``.xdmf`` / ``.xmf``, ``.vtkhdf`` or ``.pvd`` file, the formats
        polyxios reads a time series from.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[numpy.ndarray, list of polyxios.PolyData]
        The time of each step, and the mesh at it, in the file's order. A
        step whose time the file does not spell is ``nan``. Each mesh also
        carries its time under ``global_attrs["time"]``. A file holding no
        time series is one step.

    Raises
    ------
    UnsupportedFormatError
        If the file is not an XDMF, VTKHDF or PVD file, or is one that needs
        h5py - a VTKHDF, an XDMF naming an HDF5 sidecar - and h5py is not
        installed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from polyxios import helper                        # doctest: +SKIP

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps
        ``(time, mesh)`` pairs in time order. Any iterable will do, a
        generator included: each step is written as it arrives, so a run can
        stream its results without holding them all. The first mesh's
        elements are written once and every later step refers to them; a
        later mesh whose vertices moved writes its own coordinates, one
        whose elements differ is refused.
    path
        An ``.xdmf`` / ``.xmf``, ``.vtkhdf`` or ``.pvd`` file, the formats
        polyxios writes a time series to.
    **opts
        Passed to the codec. XDMF takes ``data_format`` (``"hdf"``, the
        default, needs h5py; ``"xml"`` keeps the arrays inline; ``"binary"``
        writes one raw sidecar) and, with VTKHDF, ``compression`` and
        ``compression_opts`` for the HDF5 datasets; PVD takes ``format``
        for the extension of the dataset each step is written to.

    Raises
    ------
    UnsupportedFormatError
        If the file is not an XDMF, VTKHDF or PVD file, or is one that needs
        h5py - a VTKHDF, an XDMF with its default HDF5 sidecar - and h5py is
        not installed.
    CodecError
        If ``steps`` is empty, or a step's elements differ from the first's.
