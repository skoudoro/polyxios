"""PVD codec - ParaView's collection file, an index of datasets over time.

A ``.pvd`` file holds no geometry. It is a short XML document - a
``<VTKFile type="Collection">`` root with a ``<Collection>`` of ``<DataSet>``
elements - and each ``DataSet`` names another file, its ``timestep``, and
the ``part`` and ``group`` it belongs to when a step is split across
several. The files it names are whatever VTK writes: ``.vtu``, ``.vtp``,
``.vti``, a parallel ``.pvtu`` index, and they are found beside the index
by the relative path it spells.

:func:`read` hands back one mesh, always: every dataset at one time step
merged, the first step unless ``step=`` says otherwise. The whole series is
read by :func:`read_time_series` and written by :func:`write_time_series`,
both reached through :mod:`polyxios.helper`; :func:`write` is the one-step
series, its dataset written beside the index.

def read(path: Source, *, lazy: bool = False, **opts: Any) -> PolyData:
    """Read a PVD collection at one time step and return a PolyData.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path
        Path to the ``.pvd`` file. A file object is refused: the datasets
        the index names are found beside it, and a handle has no beside.
    lazy
        Passed to the reader of each dataset. A step held in one dataset
        comes back as that reader hands it out - views of a ``.vtu`` with a
        raw appended section, say - while a step split across several is
        merged, which copies. A dataset that is itself an index - a
        ``.pvtu`` naming its pieces - is merged the same way, through
        :func:`polyxios.helper.read_multiblock`, which reads eagerly.
    **opts
        ``step`` picks the time step, counted from zero and negative from
        the end the way a list is; the first is read without it. Every
        dataset at that step is merged into the one mesh and, when there
        are several, tagged the way ParaView groups them: the datasets of
        one ``group`` share its tag, which names every element of every
        one of them, and a dataset naming no group is ``part_<n>``, ``n``
        its place among the step's datasets counted from zero. A name
        already in use - a tag a dataset carries, or another group's - is
        left to it, and the collection's gets a number appended.

    Returns
    -------
    PolyData
        The mesh, its step's ``timestep`` under ``global_attrs["time"]``.

    Raises
    ------
    CodecError
        If the file is not a collection, names no dataset, names one outside
        its own directory, or ``step`` is not a whole number or names a step
        it does not have; and whatever the dataset's own reader raises.
    LazyReadError
        If ``lazy`` is set and a dataset's codec cannot map its file - a
        ``.vtkhdf``, whose arrays h5py decodes whole. ``lazy`` is handed
        on as asked, not dropped: a caller that wants views over a
        collection of such files reads it eagerly instead.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        When two datasets at one step spell a ``global_attrs`` key
        differently; the later dataset's value is the one kept.
