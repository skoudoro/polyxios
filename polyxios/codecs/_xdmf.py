"""XDMF codec - an XML description of a mesh whose arrays live wherever it says.

An XDMF file is two things: the *light data*, an XML tree naming the grids,
their topology and geometry, the attributes on them and the time each grid
belongs to; and the *heavy data*, the arrays themselves, which every
``<DataItem>`` in the tree either holds inline (``Format="XML"``), names in
an HDF5 file (``Format="HDF"``, the usual case and the reason the format
exists) or names in a raw binary file (``Format="Binary"``). The HDF5 case
needs h5py, which is optional: without it the XML and binary flavours still
read and write, and an HDF5 reference is refused with the ``pip install``
line that fixes it.

A file holds one uniform grid, several of them, or a temporal collection of
them - a time series, each step a grid of its own. :func:`read` hands back
one mesh, always: several grids at one time are merged, each grid's elements
tagged with the grid's name; a time series is read at one step, the first
unless ``step=`` says otherwise. The whole series is read by
:func:`read_time_series`, and written by :func:`write_time_series`, both
reached through :mod:`polyxios.helper`.

# =============================================================================


def read(path: Source, *, lazy: bool = False, **opts: Any) -> PolyData:
    """Read an XDMF file and return a PolyData.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path
        Path to the ``.xdmf`` / ``.xmf`` file, or an open file object. A file
        whose arrays live in an HDF5 or binary sidecar needs a path, since
        the sidecar is found beside it; one holding its arrays inline reads
        from anything.
    lazy
        Map the sidecars instead of reading them, and hand back arrays that
        view the mappings, read-only, in the dtype and byte order the
        sidecar holds. A Binary DataItem is one run of values at an offset,
        and so is an HDF5 dataset stored contiguously without a filter -
        h5py finds where it sits and the file is mapped around it. A
        chunked or compressed dataset, or values spelled inline as text,
        have no such run and raise. Derived arrays - the offsets of a
        uniform topology, the element types, a mixed topology's gathered
        connectivity, coordinates padded from two columns to three, and
        what a ``HyperSlab`` or ``Function`` DataItem computes - are
        built in memory; the offsets are int32, or int64 when they need
        it, whatever dtype the connectivity keeps.
    **opts
        ``step`` picks the time step of a temporal collection, counted from
        zero and negative from the end the way a list is; the first is read
        without it. Every uniform grid at that step is merged into the one
        mesh, each grid's elements tagged with the grid's name when there
        are several.

    Returns
    -------
    PolyData
        The mesh. A ``<Time>`` value lands in ``global_attrs["time"]``, a
        ``<Set>`` in the tags, an ``<Information>`` in ``global_attrs`` as
        text and a Grid-centred ``<Attribute>`` there as an array.

    Raises
    ------
    LazyReadError
        If ``lazy`` is set and a DataItem holds its values inline, in a
        chunked or compressed HDF5 dataset, or in a sidecar that cannot be
        mapped.
    CodecError
        If the file is not XDMF, a grid lacks its topology or geometry, a
        ``DataItem`` declares a size it does not hold, an HDF5 or binary
        reference resolves outside the file's own directory, or ``step``
        names a step the file does not have.
    UnsupportedFormatError
        If an HDF5 reference is met and h5py is not installed. The message
        names the extra that installs it.
    UnknownElementTypeError
        If a mixed topology carries a cell code XDMF does not define.

    Parameters
    ----------
    poly
        PolyData to write.
    path
        Output file path, or an open file object for the ``"xml"`` data
        format only: the other two write a sidecar beside the file, and a
        file object has no beside.
    **opts
        ``data_format`` says where the arrays go: ``"hdf"`` (the default)
        writes them to an HDF5 file named after this one, ``out.h5`` beside
        ``out.xdmf``, and needs h5py; ``"binary"`` writes them to one raw
        ``out.bin`` beside it; ``"xml"`` keeps them inline in the XML.
        ``compression`` and ``compression_opts`` are passed to h5py for the
        HDF5 datasets - ``compression="gzip"`` with ``compression_opts=4``
        is the usual pair - and mean nothing to the other two formats.
        ``time`` is written as the grid's ``<Time Value>``; without it, a
        number under ``global_attrs["time"]`` is.

    Raises
    ------
    CodecError
        If ``data_format`` names none of the three, a sidecar format is asked
        for on a file object or a gzip path, or the mesh's vertices are not
        a coordinate block.
    UnsupportedFormatError
        If the HDF5 format is asked for and h5py is not installed.

    Notes
    -----
    The mesh is one ``<Grid GridType="Uniform">``: a ``<Geometry>`` of
    ``XYZ`` - ``XY`` for a mesh that came from a two-dimensional file and
    stayed in the plane - and one ``<Topology>``, named for the element type
    when every element is of one type and ``Mixed`` otherwise. A pixel and a
    voxel go out as the quadrilateral and hexahedron they are, corners
    reordered; an element type XDMF has no name for is dropped with a
    warning per type, and the arrays and tags over the elements are cut to
    match. ``vertex_attrs`` and ``element_attrs`` are ``<Attribute>``
    elements centred on ``Node`` and ``Cell``; the tags are ``<Set>``
    elements of ``Node`` and ``Cell`` type; a numeric ``global_attrs`` value
    is an ``<Attribute Center="Grid">``, a text one an ``<Information>``.
